# Is your child too young to start school?

## What's this about?

In NSW, Australia, there is "conventional wisdom" provided by most educators I have encountered which says if you have the option based on age to send a child to school or not you
should keep them in Day Care/Preschool for the extra year because there is overwhelming evidence that it is in their best interests.

Given this is conventional wisdom for something as important as my child's ongoing health and wellbeing I decided to do some research of my own.
There are a number of conflicts of interest such as Day Care fees.
Teachers are generally likely to be people who value general education and inter-social interactions. This can lead to a system not designed with introverts in mind.


## Should we send our munchkin to school as a 5yo?

Too Young to Leave The Nest? http://ftp.iza.org/dp3452.pdf
I read this paper as telling us that being older is generally an advantage, there is a strong link between age and test scores.
Conversely also tells us that children who start school earlier do better at school for their age than peers who started later,
assumedly this is simply because they have been at school longer.
If I've read it right your daughter is less likely to get pregnant if she goes to school at a younger age.
Also children who start earlier will earn more money initially, it would seem due to entering the work force at a younger age.
How-ever this early mover advantage evens out around 30.

Age provides minimal impact compared to all other factors, age at school start should be considered but it's only small piece of the puzzle.
