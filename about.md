I'm an existentialist IT nerd who believes the only point in life is polite hedonism.  I'm interested in a great deal of things & may even write about some of them from time to time.  I love & help raise kids, work, exercise a bit, fail to grow veggies, keep bees, drink the occasional dram of whisky, & I read a bit, technical, fiction & non-fiction.  After finishing the last book [Sidney Dekker's The Field Guide to Understanding ‘Human Error’](http://sidneydekker.com/books/), I'd highlighted a bunch of passages it was high time to jot some of them, if only to summarise for myself.

As with my jokes, this is for me, if anybody else gets something out of it then that's just a bonus.

Check out the game I've been working on [Retro Touch Type][retro-touch-type]
