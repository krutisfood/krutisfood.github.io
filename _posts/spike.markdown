There's a coffee shop on Hunter Street which perfectly marries my love of books with my addiction to coffee.  Strangely up until recently it hadn't occured to me I could buy books from there, the eclectic mix of books seemed hand picked just to provide the right ambience.



I love the smell of ~a two stroke~ books and coffee.

Pukoon: 1963
Chapter 5
"Here, safe in its bureaucratic cocoon, we have the new vandalism of authority, power without conscience or taste;"

pg 125
Born screaming into this world -
Living I am
Occupational therapy twixt birth and death -
What was I before?
What will I be next?
What am I now?
Cruel answer carried in the jesting mind
    of a careless God.
I will not bend and grovel
When I die. If he says my sins are myriad
I will ask why He made me so imperfect
And he will say 'My chisels were blunt'.
I will say _'Then why did you make so_
    _many of me'._
Bethlehem Hospital
Highgate 1966
