# The Story of my Stroke

## The story begins.
Difficulty swallowing, wash down the steak with house red wine :)
Assuming this is probably just stress of applying for my first professional job while finishing uni and working full time doing data entry.
Full time job data entry, part time job picking vegetables, finishing university, interviewing for my first professional job, gf (something I didn't have much experience with!), uncontrollable fits of laughter where I would literally become so short of breath unable to breath that I nearly passed out.
Sister moved to Adelaide for uni, brother moved to Newcastle for work, parents marriage ended, Dad suffered a breakdown.

It's probably just stress causing the gag reflex, hay fever causing the static in my ears, RSI causing the tingling in right hand and right foot,
I've no explanation for why my right leg uncontrollably shakes sometimes, I have started wetting my pants a little before I can get to the toilet, the weakness I've only just noticed on my left side giving me a limp, slurred speech, double vision. To say nothing of the uncontrollable laughing fits...
Trying to jog across the road to get out of the way of an oncoming car, also struggling to lift my motorbike off the kick stand. Probably should start driving until the symptoms clear up.
Driving the car I took to covering one eye when-ever I had to navigate between two objects to ensure my worsening double vision doesn't cause me to hit anything (or anyone).

## CT Brain Scan (to make sure I have one)
CT Scan, "Hold still, don't move"
Me: "Aaaaah-chooo!"
Immediately the scans stopped, I was placed in a wheelchair, given two sudafed to reduce risk of allergic reaction, then left sitting around for half an hour to make sure I was still alive.

The next day walking back up to the house after moving a bunch of wood around and lighting a bon fire on our hobby farm...
Al: "Are you ok?"
Me: "Fine, just have to tie my shoes!" I'm lying, really I'm struggling to make my body walk up the hill, out of breath at the effort of dragging the unresponsive left side of my body.
Al: "You know we could have been on a paid holiday at the beach."

The next day the Dr rang to say "Pack an overnight bag when you come in". Not exactly a call you want to hear.

## Emergency
We headed straight down to John Hunter Emergency, registered at the desk.
After 2 full hours in the ER waiting room I was finally called up.
Triage Nurse in a surly voice: "So, what's wrong with you?"
Me: "I had a brain haemorrhage"
Nurse: "What makes you think that?"
Me: "My Dr told me...?"
Nurse: "Oh! You're that guy! We've been wondering where you were."
Me: ...

48hours in the emergency ward janitor's closet (literally, they'd cleaned it out because they ran out of room), then moved to Gynaecology which had become the emergency room overflow for a few days, gave my GP a chuckle when she rang up to apologise for missing the symptoms. Then on to Neuro and Spinal ward with stroke survivors, people who had injured their backs falling off ladders while putting up xmas lights.

John Hunter Neurosurgeon
Dr: "It's a bit deeper than I'm used to operating on but I could see what I could do..." he says, trailing off and not once making eye contact.
Me: "I'm all for giving things a go but not terribly excited about you Giving it a crack when we're talking about a highly complicated operation on the centre of my brain!"
Mum: "We have private health insurance."
Dr: "Right this way sir!"

Early the next morning I was taken by patient transport to Dalcross Private to one of only two surgeons in Australia who operate in this area of the brain.
Patient transport
"We were expecting someone _much_ older!"

The last Friday before xmas in 2003
Pre-Op: "Do you have any questions?"
Me: "Yes, will I set off airport metal detectors?"
Unimpressed Prof Morgan: "No."

Prof Morgan assumes re-assuring body language, "You'll be fine, I've done this before and the risks are low"
Me: "I know, after all... It's not rocket science"
_Silence_
Did I just insult the person who is about to be poking around in my skull?

Three hours after my scheduled time with a room crowded with family and friends, initially anxiously anticipating, now mainly just bored.
"We've reviewed your case and think you should spend some time at home taking steroid medication to let the swelling go down"
(Not so) secretly I wonder if it were simply that operating on me would have bled into the xmas holidays for staff, got to be on time for flights to the cook islands!

I now know something most people don't, brain fluid (Cerebro Spinal Fluid - CBF) tastes a bit salty and leads to reflux when it's continually dripping down the back of your throat!
Another four hour Operation later, one week of recovery in hospital and I was on my own with just the assurance "you'll heal"

Nearly the whole time I was in hospital I was supported by my girlfriend (now wife), and mum who lived with my wonderful great aunty Molly who had never even met my gf! Unfortunately I was rubbish company, with my new double vision and surprising headache I unable to focus on anything, not even able to watch TV.
Post Op one OT session then kicked out.

## Centrelink - Pre Op
"What's wrong with you then?!"
"I had a stroke"
"Oh... come this way..."

## Centrelink - Post Op
Staples in head, large bandage, right eye swollen shut, left eye blood shot, walking slowly with a heavy limp.
Consultant, not looking up: "How are you today?"
Me, wry grin: "I've been better"
Consultant looks up: "Oh..."

Day of the devil (6/6/06) I had squint surgery, went to great pains to re-assure people my horribly blood shot eyes were not anything satanic.
Put a strong hand on my forhead, _yank_, _yank_, the world jiggling naseatingly from side to side.

I have long wondered if there is value in telling the story of my brain haemorrhage, particularly when I have recovered to the point I'm able to operate normally in society when many around were not so lucky. Survivor's guilt is real even though the minor disabilities are constant reminders. Since reading ["reinventing emma" by Emma Gee][reinventing-emma] I feel perhaps it's worth giving a story of hope for those questioning whether they should go through with a craniotomy to rectify and AVM, Cavernoma or similar deep in the brain stem.
