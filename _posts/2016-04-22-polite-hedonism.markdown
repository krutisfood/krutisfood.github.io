My life ethos, & guiding principle: _"Polite Hedonism"_.

_Caution:_ I am a bleak individual with a sunny disposition which I maintain by reminding myself how trivial all our concerns really are. Be prepared to tackle your own existential angst before reading any further...

#### What is polite hedonism?
If you want a good definition of hedonism I'd suggest you head to the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism), but to me hedonism is simply doing things you enjoy.

#### Why polite hedonism?
I like the idea of respecting my fellow humans and love the idea of pay it forward. Ergo, living for pleasure in a nice way seems like a pretty good idea to me, and it should be more sustainable than general hedonism; I'm pretty sure normal hedonism would lead to liver failure, lung cancer, a whole bunch of STIs, or just someone refusing to put up with me any longer & putting me out of everybody else's misery.

#### How on earth did you get to this point?!
It started in the usual manner of pondering existence & wondering how to maximise my life.  Oh, I'd had a pretty serious stroke during my final years at uni too, thankfully it was a slow bleed so I finished final year exams, it just took some major centre of the brain style surgery & a few years to get back close enough to 100%.  The general cliche is about these things being life changing, I evaluated my life (like you're supposed to), did a lot of soul searching & generally decided I was happy with who I was.  And generally I still am. Though part of what I'm happy with is I'm always thinking about things I should be doing better.

After this I read some self help books, blogs, ted talks, videos about motivation, blogs about avoiding materialism to find greater meaning in life. Some of the more influential include (but not limited to, *disclosure*, some of these are affiliate links to Amazon):

* [People's top 5 regrets on their death beds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZXTMmYfOsc)
* [Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene: 40th Anniversary Edition (Oxford Landmark Science)][selfish-gene]
* [Daniel H. Pink's Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us][drive]
* [Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: The Story of Success][outliers]
* [Stephen R. Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Interactive Edition][7-habits]
* [Early Retirement Extreme](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/)
* [Mr Money Moustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/)
* [The Minimalists](http://www.theminimalists.com/)

Ok, seemed like a lot more books when I was thinking about it but all I really know is I've forgotten several, and there's a few more which aren't relevant here.

#### My anchor
And here we are!

My continual anchor is the assumption that in 20 years it won't matter what my job title is now, in 100 years most of my life won't have mattered to anyone else except my decendants, even if I cure cancer (that I got from all that hedonism) it'll take a bit longer but eventually the heat death of the universe will ensure it was all in vain. Or some nuclear holocaust. Or zombies riding segways.  Which ever way you get the same result.

So lighten up!  These concerns which are weighing you down are nothing in the scheme of things, they probably won't even matter tomorrow let alone after the heat death of the universe.

Relax, have a nice day :)
